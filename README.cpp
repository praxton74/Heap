# Heap

priority_queue<int> pq;
  
priority_queue <int, vector<int>, greater<int> > pq;

  
 A priority queue is a type of dynamic container in STL. It stores the elements in a sorted order where the first element of the queue is the greatest of all and the other elements are sorted in non-increasing order. 

They are implemented as a heap in memory. The greatest element will be the one that will be deleted first. They are present in #include<queue> header file.
